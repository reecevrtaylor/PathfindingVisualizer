## About The Project üéì
The Pathfinding Visualizer is an educational tool designed for learners to explore and understand pathfinding algorithms, visualizing their operations in real-time.

Originally, I embarked on this project to enhance my comprehension of algorithms‚Äîa cornerstone of computer science. By developing this visualization tool, I could witness algorithmic behaviors firsthand. The overarching goal was not only to complete the project but to mature as a software developer. I believe this endeavor, combined with the knowledge I've gained through research and hands-on experience, has greatly enriched my skills.

## Technical Documentation üìù
This section delves into the technical specifics of the project, from its architecture to algorithmic implementations.

### Project Configuration
The Pathfinding Visualizer adopts an object-oriented design, comprising nine integral classes.

</div>

The structured approach facilitates easy augmentation with additional features, classes, heuristics, or algorithms. The synergy between classes ensures a seamless user experience and workflow, a pivotal element in this project's success.

### Features Overview
* **Nodes**: Represented by each tile on the grid.
* **Start Node**: The algorithm's initiation point.
* **End Node**: The algorithm's termination point.
* **Walls**: Barriers the algorithm will bypass.
* **Open Node**: Nodes currently under algorithmic evaluation.
* **Closed Node**: Nodes previously evaluated by the algorithm.
* **Path**: The finalized route determined by the algorithm.

### Algorithms and Heuristics
This project incorporates various pathfinding algorithms and heuristics, including:
* A-Star Search (A*)
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Depth-First Search (DFS)

Heuristics utilized are:
* Manhattan Distance
* Euclidean Distance
* Diagonal Distance
* Dijkstra (no heuristic)
* Chebyshev Distance
* Random Walk Iteration

For an in-depth exploration of each feature, algorithm, and heuristic, please consult the provided [examples](#examples).

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
Continuous enhancement is at the heart of this project. I aim to integrate additional features, bolstering the user experience further.

**Planned Additions**:
- Ability to alter grid dimensions.
- Finalizing the DFS algorithm.

**Known Issues**:
- Dragging the start node leaves a trail, mimicking wall behavior. This minor glitch doesn't hamper functionality and is rectified upon pressing any button.
